Firstly, the report raises some questions based on the dataset needed to be researched. Secondly, the dataset is cleaned and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is implemented to find the insight according to the research questions. Finally, the conclusion is drawn to illustrate these insights.

The tools used in this report are Python libraries - `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`. The Jupyter notebook is used to illustrate the interactive analysis.
